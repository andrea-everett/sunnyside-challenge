# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

This challenge gave me a clearer understanding of CSS Grid and Flex. I have a better understand of how to format Navbars, images, and text within specific areas of a webpage. I also learned many style tools to create hover effects over buttons.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="client-section">
            <title>CLIENT TESTIMONIALS</title>
            <div class="client-card-row">
                <div class="client-card">
                    <div class="client-img"><img src="./images/image-emily.jpg"></div>
                    <p>We put our trust in Sunnyside and they delivered, 
                        making sure our needs were met and deadlines were always hit.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Emily R.</h1>
                    <h2>Marketing Director</h2>
                </div>
```

```css
.button1::before {
    background-color: rgb(250, 212, 0);
    position: relative;
    display: block;
    content: '';
    width: 115%;
    height: 0.5em;
    transform: translateY(1.3em) translateX(-7%);
    border-radius: 50vw;
    opacity: .2;
    z-index: -1;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to dive deeper into CSS Grid and Flex and how it can be applied to more intricate webpages. I spent a lot of time working on the testimonial section to format the images, headers, and paragraphs correctly using CSS Grid. I would like to work on a more intricate project using these tools.

### Useful resources
